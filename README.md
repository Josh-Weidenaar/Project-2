The James Beard Cookbook Award Analysis
The James Beard Foundation is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to celebrate, nurture, 
and honor chefs and other leaders making America's food culture more delicious, diverse, and sustainable for everyone.
In order to qualify, a restaurant or dining space’s design must have remained substantially unchanged for at least 20 years 
and must have influenced and inspired the design of subsequent restaurant and dining spaces. Additionally, the restaurant/dining 
space must still be in operation.
The James Beard Foundation’s Leadership Awards spotlight the important and complex realms of sustainability, food justice, and public health. 
They raise awareness of these timely issues by celebrating the visionaries responsible for creating a healthier, safer, and more equitable, 
and sustainable food system.
The Leadership Awards recognize specific outstanding initiatives as well as bodies of work and lifetime achievement. The excellence of work, 
innovation in approach, and scale of impact within a community or the nation are among the criteria used to select the recipients. Honorees 
are chosen by a volunteer committee of experts and the cohort of past Leadership Award recipients. 
The Foundation will award 2020 honorees a $10,000 cash prize to each honoree.
We scraped awards for all available years from 1991-2020.
Through the use of two Wikipedia API's we were able to identify the gender of the honorees in order to evaluate the gender breakdown of
both nominees and winners.
